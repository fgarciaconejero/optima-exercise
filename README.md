# optima-exercise

Hi there! My name is Facu.

Please do keep in mind that, although I do have C# .NET experience, I've been developing in Go for the last year. I think I did a good job, but I may have missed some C#-specific details. However, I strongly believe that after a couple of days of getting back to developing in it, I won't be missing them anymore.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it!
