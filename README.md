# **Football World Cup Score Board**
Hi there, my name is Facu and this is my implementation of the Football World Cup Score Board!

<br>

## Installation ðŸ”§
### - Clone the repository.
### - Open the **solution** (not just the folder).
### - Build the solution, preferably in "Release mode", but it isn't mandatory.
### - Run it from VS or go to the "bin" folder and look for a ".exe" file (inside the "Debug" or "Release" folder,  depending on how you chose to build the solution).

Please do keep in mind that, although I do have C# .NET experience, I've been developing in Go for the last year. I think I did a good job, but I may have missed some C#-specific details. **However, I strongly believe that after a couple of days of getting back to developing in it, I won't be missing them anymore.**

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it!
