# optima-exercise

Hi there! My name is Facu.

Please do keep in mind that, although I do have C# .NET experience, I've been developing in Go for the last year. I think I did a good job, but I may have missed some C#-specific details. However, I strongly believe that after a couple of days of getting back to developing in it, I won't be missing them anymore.

Also, the "ConsoleHandler" class was only created for me to be able to test everything other than console reads and writes, since I found it really difficult and from what I've researched, there is not a way to automate a test to read the console. My goal by doing this was issolating the Console.ReadLine() and Console.WriteLine() functions so that the rest of it could be properly tested, mocking some values instead of getting/posting them from/into the console.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on it!
